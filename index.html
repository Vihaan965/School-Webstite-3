   The school is St. Joseph Collage in allhabad is ICSE not CBSE.
   <p id="Klad"> St. Joseph's College, founded in 1884, by the Capuchin Friars of the province of Ancona and Bologna, Italy, is an English Medium college for boys. It is owned and managed by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Prayagraj. It is a private, minority and unaided (Anglo Indian) school. It exists primarily to educate Catholic boys, but is open to other boys as well, without discrimination of caste, creed and culture.

The College has nurtures students through the 20th Century and flourishes in the 21st century as well, with an unblemished service to the cause of education.

The school began with a small parochial school for the Catholic Parish, first located in a rented house. The Foundation stone of the building was laid by Rt. Rev. Dr. Francis Pesci on 1st January, 1884. Bishop Angelo Poli called this little school, St. Joseph's Collegiate. In 1887, it became a middle school, recognized as 'European High School', affiliated to Cambridge University. In 1907, it directly came under the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Prayagraj and the Parish Priest of St. Joseph's Cathedral. It was handed over to the Irish Christian Brothers of Nainital in 1908 and they looked after it till 1916, when Bishop Gamigna took over. With a boarding of 26 students, the number went up to 63 in 1920. Rev. Fr. Camilus, OFM Cap. extended the school building in 1922 and with the coming of Msgr. O' Hogan, the new headmaster in 1921, the school reached the pinnacle of glory and continues to stand tall even today owing to the hard work and dedication of all the Principals, Vice-Principals, Headmasters and Teachers, who have left no stone unturned in imparting knowledge, through value based instruction to over 5000 students every year.

Every Josephite is trained to live up to the motto of the institution, 'Semper Sursum' which in Latin means 'ALWAYS AIM HIGH'.

We endeavour to mould young minds by strengthening them socially, morally, emotionally and intellectually, presenting to the society at large, a man of principles and firm conviction.

we strive towards building a person who:

- has respect for human values
- can stand up for what is right
- is able to accept both success and failure in the right spirit
- has the ability to adjust effectively to the physical and emotional changes through different stages of life

- has a thirst for knowledge
- has the capacity for critical thinking and logical reasoning
